## 📌 Project Tasks Overview

### ✅ Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed customer data to identify patterns, missing values, and high-risk indicators.
* Imputed missing income values using a normal distribution-based method.
* Summarized key risk factors like **missed payments** and **credit utilization** affecting delinquency risk.

---

### ✅ Task 2: Predictive Model Framework

* Designed the logic for a predictive model to forecast customer delinquency.
* Chose **Logistic Regression** for its interpretability and financial services suitability.
* Outlined a model evaluation plan using metrics like **Accuracy, F1 Score, AUC, and fairness checks**.
* Justified the model’s fit for Geldium’s operational and compliance needs.

---

### ✅ Task 3: Business Recommendations & Responsible AI

* Identified top risk factors for delinquency and created a SMART business recommendation to reduce it.
* Addressed fairness and bias risks in AI decisions and proposed mitigation strategies.
* Focused on transparent, ethical AI use, especially for financial decision-making.

---

### ✅ Task 4: AI Collections System Design & Business Impact

* Designed an end-to-end workflow for an AI-powered collections system (from customer data input to action and learning loop).
* Defined the role of **Agentic AI** with human oversight in high-impact decisions.
* Outlined Responsible AI guardrails for fairness, explainability, and regulatory alignment.
* Listed expected **business KPIs** and ways to enhance operational efficiency and customer experience.
